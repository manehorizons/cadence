## rec-20260602-001 — Rename 'cadence init --profile' flag to '--preset'

- status: converted
- ready: ready-for-cadence-spec
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: cli
- files: packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts
- evidence: CONTEXT.md Flagged ambiguities: 'cadence init --profile sets a preset, not a profile'
- next: cadence milestone propose

The init --profile flag takes solo|team|production (a PRESET), while the domain profile is set via --gate-profile — actively misleading (flag named 'profile' does not set the profile). Rename the flag to --preset, keeping --profile as a deprecated alias. Design settled in the 2026-06-01 CONTEXT.md grilling session; needs a test (TDD), docs/reference/commands.md update, and the two-commit settle.

## rec-20260602-002 — Add /cadence-scout host slash command (ideation dialogue → recs)

- status: converted
- ready: ready-for-milestone
- priority: medium

- decay: fresh
- areas: host-claude-code, praxis

- evidence: Design agreed in /resume /cadence-scout design session 2026-06-02; full design in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-cadence-scout-design.md (Option A). Sibling: deferred Option-B grouping rec.
- next: cadence milestone propose

A tenth Claude Code slash command (prompt template, installed by cadence-host-claude-code) that runs a CADENCE-aware divergent→convergent ideation dialogue and lands survivors as Praxis recommendations via existing 'cadence recommendation add'. Named scout (not brainstorm) — it is the opposite end of the superpowers brainstorming skill: divergent candidate generation into the ranked ledger, never design→plan. Zero core-engine change, no new gate/loop position/record type. Fills the gap of an in-tool structured ideation dialogue that today forces leaving the tool and hand-entering results.

## rec-20260602-003 — [Deferred] First-class scout-session grouping on recommendations

- status: converted
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: low
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: praxis, types
- files: packages/types/src, packages/core/src
- evidence: Explicitly deferred in /cadence-scout design session 2026-06-02 (chose 'A now, B as follow-up rec'). Sibling of rec-20260602-002. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-cadence-scout-design.md.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Option B from the /cadence-scout design: add an optional scoutId/sourceSessionId to the recommendation schema (cadence-types) + a --scout-id flag, surfaced as a cluster in 'cadence recommend', so the N recs from one /cadence-scout session are queryable as a set. Deferred: spends a permanent schema surface for unproven traceability need and overlaps the existing generic evidence mechanism. Clean additive follow-up if the need appears.

## rec-20260603-001 — Enable windows-latest CI leg (timeout + EBUSY harness fixes)

- status: converted
- ready: needs-decision

- evidence: PR #19 CI run 26912393990: macos-latest 20/22 green, ubuntu green; windows-latest 20/22 failed with 20s/30s timeouts + EBUSY rmdir on temp cleanup.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Phase 49 unblocked macOS via realpath but deferred Windows. Enabling windows-latest surfaced Windows-only test-harness issues: (1) settle-security-audit.test.ts AC-4 and dispatcher.test.ts 'skill-invoke caps at 100 entries' exceed the vitest timeout on Windows runners (CLI-spawn + git + 100 atomic writes are slower there); (2) temp-dir cleanup hits EBUSY (rmdir, open handle) past the fixture's rm retry budget (maxRetries:5/retryDelay:100). Fix: raise fixture cleanup retry budget for EBUSY; address the slow Windows tests without per-test timeout band-aids (CLAUDE.md rule) — likely a Windows-aware global timeout or reducing per-test CLI-spawn count; consider an injectable renameWithRetry for testability. Then add windows-latest back to the ci.yml matrix + the ci-matrix.test.ts guard.

## rec-20260604-001 — Expose CADENCE as an MCP server surface

- status: converted
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core, packages/host-claude-code
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Highest ecosystem leverage of the session. Tension/sibling: 'Host-adapter authoring guide' (MCP may obsolete bespoke adapters — decide which path before building either).
- next: cadence milestone propose

Ship an MCP server that exposes the DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop as MCP tools, so any MCP-capable agent (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, etc.) can drive CADENCE without a bespoke per-host adapter. Could reframe the whole multi-host question — one surface instead of N adapters.

## rec-20260604-002 — Host-adapter authoring guide + stable capabilities contract

- status: converted
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: docs, packages/host-claude-code
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Sibling: rec-20260604-001 (MCP surface) — decide MCP-vs-adapters direction first; this guide only pays off if bespoke adapters remain the path.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Document the host-adapter contract (event-map, shim, capabilities) and publish an authoring guide so the community can write adapters (Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI) instead of the maintainer building each. Force-multiplier: scales the ecosystem without solo effort. Codex host was started then archived (phases 02→11), so the contract exists implicitly — this makes it explicit and reusable.

## rec-20260604-003 — cadence doctor — diagnose project setup

- status: converted
- ready: needs-evidence
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Concrete + well-scoped. Motivated directly by the 2026-06-04 broken-slash-command-path bug (committed --local Windows path) — a doctor check would have caught it. Siblings: rec-20260604-001, rec-20260604-002.
- next: cadence milestone propose

A 'cadence doctor' subcommand that checks a project's setup health: hooks wired into settings.json, hooksPath configured, Node >=20, config schema valid, and slash-command run-lines portable (no machine-absolute paths). Surfaces silent misconfig that otherwise looks like CADENCE being broken.

## rec-20260604-004 — Recommendation promotion CLI — make milestone propose reachable

- status: converted
- ready: needs-evidence
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core, packages/types
- evidence: Discovered 2026-06-04 while starting phase 56 from rec-20260604-003: 'cadence milestone propose' returned None because no rec can reach accepted/ready-for-milestone. isEligible() in intelligence/milestone.ts gates on those; store/recommendations.ts only defines the 'convert' transition. spec new --from-rec is the current workaround. Sibling/context: rec-20260604-003 (cadence doctor) surfaced it.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Add CLI to advance a recommendation's status (candidate → accepted) and readiness (→ needs-decision/ready-for-milestone/ready-for-cadence-spec). Today the only rec status transition is 'convert' (→ converted), and readiness is write-once at 'add' time — so 'cadence milestone propose', which requires status=accepted AND readiness∈{ready-for-milestone,ready-for-cadence-spec}, can never be fed a manually-added rec. The whole milestone-clustering → accept → export-to-SPEC pipeline is unreachable from the CLI for manual recs.

## rec-20260605-001 — cadence tutorial — guided first-loop walkthrough

- status: converted

- next: cadence milestone propose

Interactive walkthrough that runs one toy DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop end-to-end so a newcomer sees the loop in ~2 minutes. Reduces time-to-first-aha; largest build of the onboarding scout set.

## rec-20260605-002 — First-run 'what now?' nudge after cadence init

- next: cadence milestone propose

After 'cadence init', print the exact next loop commands (draft new → approve → ...) so the user is not left at a 'now what?' cliff. Tiny, high-ROI removal of the first-5-minutes drop-off.

In-CLI help for loop / gates / tiers / profiles so users do not have to leave the terminal for docs. Reuses existing docs content; makes the tool self-teaching.

New 'cadence mcp install [--print] [--client]' subcommand: non-destructive idempotent merge of project .mcp.json; --print snippet for Claude Desktop/Cursor. Phase 78.

## rec-20260607-005 — Phase 80 — structured logger foundation

Zero-dependency operator-debugging logger: LogLevel/LogRecord types in cadence-types, logger.ts + pure formatters in core, CADENCE_LOG_LEVEL/FORMAT env + config.logging block, stderr-only, default-off. Foundation only (no seam wiring or one trivial seam).

Wire gate decisions, hook/event dispatch, and verifier provider calls through the logger via bound child loggers; migrate only diagnostic/error console.* calls at those seams. Per-seam tests + stdout-purity test.

## rec-20260607-007 — Phase 82 — observability docs + release v1.17.0

Docs (config.md logging block + env vars, logging.md/concepts note, DESIGN.md section), changeset, lockstep 1.16.0→1.17.0 bump across all four published packages, tag + provenance.

## rec-20260608-001 — Handoff retention policy — auto-prune stale SESSION docs

- evidence: 30 SESSION docs accumulated by v1.19; manually pruned to 1 on 2026-06-08
- next: cadence milestone propose

cadence handoff accumulates dated .cadence/handoff/SESSION-*.md docs indefinitely (30 had piled up by v1.19, manually pruned to 1). Add an opt-in retention policy that supersedes stale handoffs automatically. Design notes from 2026-06-08: (1) trigger at handoff-WRITE time, not settle — settle fires per-phase and would race the lastHandoff pointer mid-session; handoff is when a new doc obsoletes the prior. (2) Prefer retention-by-count (keep lastHandoff + most recent N) over merged-to-main detection — deterministic, offline, no git introspection. (3) Make it opt-in/configurable (handoff.retain knob, default off or generous), same posture as phaseGuard — the resume skill leans on the dated archive existing, so never silently destructive.

## rec-20260610-001 — Phase-id schema caps phases at 99 (two digits)

- status: candidate
- ready: needs-decision
- priority: high
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: cadence-types, phase-id, loop-state
- files: packages/types/src/plan.ts, packages/types/src/spec.ts
- evidence: Hit live on 2026-06-10 cutting v1.22: 'Invalid string: must match pattern /^\d{2}-\d{2}$/' on phase 100.
- next: cadence milestone propose

PlanZ/SpecZ id regex /^\d{2}-\d{2}$/ in cadence-types (plan.ts:28, spec.ts:12) rejects 3-digit phase numbers, so 'cadence draft new … 100' generates an invalid id (10-100) and draft approve/coherence fail. CADENCE could not represent its own phase 100; the v1.22 release was cut outside the loop. Fix: widen the regex (e.g. /^\d{2,}-\d{2,}$/) + the id-derivation/padding, with tests at the 99→100 boundary.
