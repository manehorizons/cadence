## rec-20260602-001 — Rename 'cadence init --profile' flag to '--preset'

- status: shipped
- ready: ready-for-cadence-spec
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: cli
- files: packages/core/src/cli/commands/init.ts
- evidence: CONTEXT.md Flagged ambiguities: 'cadence init --profile sets a preset, not a profile'
- next: cadence milestone propose

The init --profile flag takes solo|team|production (a PRESET), while the domain profile is set via --gate-profile — actively misleading (flag named 'profile' does not set the profile). Rename the flag to --preset, keeping --profile as a deprecated alias. Design settled in the 2026-06-01 CONTEXT.md grilling session; needs a test (TDD), docs/reference/commands.md update, and the two-commit settle.

## rec-20260602-002 — Add /cadence-scout host slash command (ideation dialogue → recs)

- status: shipped
- ready: ready-for-milestone
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: host-claude-code, praxis
- files: packages/host-claude-code/src, docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-cadence-scout-design.md
- evidence: Design agreed in /resume /cadence-scout design session 2026-06-02; full design in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-cadence-scout-design.md (Option A). Sibling: deferred Option-B grouping rec.
- next: cadence milestone propose

A tenth Claude Code slash command (prompt template, installed by cadence-host-claude-code) that runs a CADENCE-aware divergent→convergent ideation dialogue and lands survivors as Praxis recommendations via existing 'cadence recommendation add'. Named scout (not brainstorm) — it is the opposite end of the superpowers brainstorming skill: divergent candidate generation into the ranked ledger, never design→plan. Zero core-engine change, no new gate/loop position/record type. Fills the gap of an in-tool structured ideation dialogue that today forces leaving the tool and hand-entering results.

## rec-20260602-003 — [Deferred] First-class scout-session grouping on recommendations

- status: shipped
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: low
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: praxis, types
- files: packages/types/src, packages/core/src
- evidence: Explicitly deferred in /cadence-scout design session 2026-06-02 (chose 'A now, B as follow-up rec'). Sibling of rec-20260602-002. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-cadence-scout-design.md.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Option B from the /cadence-scout design: add an optional scoutId/sourceSessionId to the recommendation schema (cadence-types) + a --scout-id flag, surfaced as a cluster in 'cadence recommend', so the N recs from one /cadence-scout session are queryable as a set. Deferred: spends a permanent schema surface for unproven traceability need and overlaps the existing generic evidence mechanism. Clean additive follow-up if the need appears.

## rec-20260603-001 — Enable windows-latest CI leg (timeout + EBUSY harness fixes)

- status: shipped
- ready: needs-decision
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: ci, testkit, reliability
- files: packages/testkit/src/fixture.ts, packages/core/tests/cli/settle-security-audit.test.ts, packages/core/tests/hooks/dispatcher.test.ts, .github/workflows/ci.yml, vitest.shared.ts
- evidence: PR #19 CI run 26912393990: macos-latest 20/22 green, ubuntu green; windows-latest 20/22 failed with 20s/30s timeouts + EBUSY rmdir on temp cleanup.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Phase 49 unblocked macOS via realpath but deferred Windows. Enabling windows-latest surfaced Windows-only test-harness issues: (1) settle-security-audit.test.ts AC-4 and dispatcher.test.ts 'skill-invoke caps at 100 entries' exceed the vitest timeout on Windows runners (CLI-spawn + git + 100 atomic writes are slower there); (2) temp-dir cleanup hits EBUSY (rmdir, open handle) past the fixture's rm retry budget (maxRetries:5/retryDelay:100). Fix: raise fixture cleanup retry budget for EBUSY; address the slow Windows tests without per-test timeout band-aids (CLAUDE.md rule) — likely a Windows-aware global timeout or reducing per-test CLI-spawn count; consider an injectable renameWithRetry for testability. Then add windows-latest back to the ci.yml matrix + the ci-matrix.test.ts guard.

## rec-20260604-001 — Expose CADENCE as an MCP server surface

- status: shipped
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core, packages/host-claude-code
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Highest ecosystem leverage of the session. Tension/sibling: 'Host-adapter authoring guide' (MCP may obsolete bespoke adapters — decide which path before building either).
- next: cadence milestone propose

Ship an MCP server that exposes the DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop as MCP tools, so any MCP-capable agent (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, etc.) can drive CADENCE without a bespoke per-host adapter. Could reframe the whole multi-host question — one surface instead of N adapters.

## rec-20260604-002 — Host-adapter authoring guide + stable capabilities contract

- status: shipped
- ready: raw-idea
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: docs, packages/host-claude-code
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Sibling: rec-20260604-001 (MCP surface) — decide MCP-vs-adapters direction first; this guide only pays off if bespoke adapters remain the path.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Document the host-adapter contract (event-map, shim, capabilities) and publish an authoring guide so the community can write adapters (Codex, Cursor, Copilot CLI) instead of the maintainer building each. Force-multiplier: scales the ecosystem without solo effort. Codex host was started then archived (phases 02→11), so the contract exists implicitly — this makes it explicit and reusable.

## rec-20260604-003 — cadence doctor — diagnose project setup

- status: shipped
- ready: needs-evidence
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core
- evidence: Generated in /cadence-scout session on 'adoption & ecosystem', 2026-06-04. Concrete + well-scoped. Motivated directly by the 2026-06-04 broken-slash-command-path bug (committed --local Windows path) — a doctor check would have caught it. Siblings: rec-20260604-001, rec-20260604-002.
- next: cadence milestone propose

A 'cadence doctor' subcommand that checks a project's setup health: hooks wired into settings.json, hooksPath configured, Node >=20, config schema valid, and slash-command run-lines portable (no machine-absolute paths). Surfaces silent misconfig that otherwise looks like CADENCE being broken.

## rec-20260604-004 — Recommendation promotion CLI — make milestone propose reachable

- status: shipped
- ready: needs-evidence
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: packages/core, packages/types
- evidence: Discovered 2026-06-04 while starting phase 56 from rec-20260604-003: 'cadence milestone propose' returned None because no rec can reach accepted/ready-for-milestone. isEligible() in intelligence/milestone.ts gates on those; store/recommendations.ts only defines the 'convert' transition. spec new --from-rec is the current workaround. Sibling/context: rec-20260604-003 (cadence doctor) surfaced it.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Add CLI to advance a recommendation's status (candidate → accepted) and readiness (→ needs-decision/ready-for-milestone/ready-for-cadence-spec). Today the only rec status transition is 'convert' (→ converted), and readiness is write-once at 'add' time — so 'cadence milestone propose', which requires status=accepted AND readiness∈{ready-for-milestone,ready-for-cadence-spec}, can never be fed a manually-added rec. The whole milestone-clustering → accept → export-to-SPEC pipeline is unreachable from the CLI for manual recs.

## rec-20260605-001 — cadence tutorial — guided first-loop walkthrough

- status: shipped

- next: cadence milestone propose

Interactive walkthrough that runs one toy DRAFT→BUILD→SETTLE loop end-to-end so a newcomer sees the loop in ~2 minutes. Reduces time-to-first-aha; largest build of the onboarding scout set.

## rec-20260605-002 — First-run 'what now?' nudge after cadence init

- next: cadence milestone propose

After 'cadence init', print the exact next loop commands (draft new → approve → ...) so the user is not left at a 'now what?' cliff. Tiny, high-ROI removal of the first-5-minutes drop-off.

## rec-20260605-003 — cadence explain <concept> — in-CLI concept help

In-CLI help for loop / gates / tiers / profiles so users do not have to leave the terminal for docs. Reuses existing docs content; makes the tool self-teaching.

resources/list+read+templates over a curated cadence:// table (state, roadmap, project, recommendations, phase draft/summary). Read-on-demand, no subscriptions. Phase 75.

Add the proven-out excluded commands as MCP tools (+ service extraction). Enables scout->rec->promote + session continuity over MCP. Phase 76.

Extract canonical guidance/scout-dialogue text from host-claude-code into core/guidance; expose prompts/list+get (scout, next, draft, settle). Single source of truth. Phase 77.

New 'cadence mcp install [--print] [--client]' subcommand: non-destructive idempotent merge of project .mcp.json; --print snippet for Claude Desktop/Cursor. Phase 78.

## rec-20260607-005 — Phase 80 — structured logger foundation

- evidence: Approved design 2026-06-07-observability-structured-logging-design.md; Post-v1.0 observability vector (MILESTONES.md)
- next: cadence milestone propose

Zero-dependency operator-debugging logger: LogLevel/LogRecord types in cadence-types, logger.ts + pure formatters in core, CADENCE_LOG_LEVEL/FORMAT env + config.logging block, stderr-only, default-off. Foundation only (no seam wiring or one trivial seam).

## rec-20260607-006 — Phase 81 — instrument three seams + scoped console.* migration

Wire gate decisions, hook/event dispatch, and verifier provider calls through the logger via bound child loggers; migrate only diagnostic/error console.* calls at those seams. Per-seam tests + stdout-purity test.

## rec-20260607-007 — Phase 82 — observability docs + release v1.17.0

Docs (config.md logging block + env vars, logging.md/concepts note, DESIGN.md section), changeset, lockstep 1.16.0→1.17.0 bump across all four published packages, tag + provenance.

## rec-20260608-001 — Handoff retention policy — auto-prune stale SESSION docs

- status: shipped

- evidence: 30 SESSION docs accumulated by v1.19; manually pruned to 1 on 2026-06-08
- next: cadence milestone propose

cadence handoff accumulates dated .cadence/handoff/SESSION-*.md docs indefinitely (30 had piled up by v1.19, manually pruned to 1). Add an opt-in retention policy that supersedes stale handoffs automatically. Design notes from 2026-06-08: (1) trigger at handoff-WRITE time, not settle — settle fires per-phase and would race the lastHandoff pointer mid-session; handoff is when a new doc obsoletes the prior. (2) Prefer retention-by-count (keep lastHandoff + most recent N) over merged-to-main detection — deterministic, offline, no git introspection. (3) Make it opt-in/configurable (handoff.retain knob, default off or generous), same posture as phaseGuard — the resume skill leans on the dated archive existing, so never silently destructive.

## rec-20260610-001 — Phase-id schema caps phases at 99 (two digits)

- status: shipped

- evidence: Hit live on 2026-06-10 cutting v1.22: 'Invalid string: must match pattern /^\d{2}-\d{2}$/' on phase 100.
- next: cadence milestone propose

PlanZ/SpecZ id regex /^\d{2}-\d{2}$/ in cadence-types (plan.ts:28, spec.ts:12) rejects 3-digit phase numbers, so 'cadence draft new … 100' generates an invalid id (10-100) and draft approve/coherence fail. CADENCE could not represent its own phase 100; the v1.22 release was cut outside the loop. Fix: widen the regex (e.g. /^\d{2,}-\d{2,}$/) + the id-derivation/padding, with tests at the 99→100 boundary.

## rec-20260611-001 — Recommendation lifecycle needs a terminal shipped/resolved state

- status: shipped
- ready: needs-decision
- priority: medium
- leverage: 5/10
- risk: 5/10
- confidence: 70%
- decay: fresh
- areas: recommendation-lifecycle, intelligence
- evidence: rec-20260610-001 shipped via PR #70 (merge b350630) but remains candidate/needs-decision; surfaced as a dogfooding nugget in SESSION-2026-06-11 handoff.
- next: cadence milestone propose

The rec lifecycle has no terminal status for work that has actually shipped. promote only offers candidate|accepted|deferred|rejected, and convert requires a real .cadence/phases/ dir. So a rec like rec-20260610-001 (phase-id ceiling fix) stays 'candidate/needs-decision' in the ledger even after it merged to main (PR #70) and shipped — forcing any existing status would be dishonest. Propose adding a terminal 'shipped'/'resolved' status (and a way to set it without a phases dir) so the ledger can honestly reflect delivered work.

## rec-20260619-008 — Team rollout kit

- status: candidate

- areas: onboarding, team, ci, docs
- files: README.md, docs/README.md, .github
- evidence: 2026-06-19 adoption review: solo onboarding is now decent; team adoption needs a concrete rollout path.
- next: cadence milestone propose

Add a team adoption kit: CI/PR-template guidance or `cadence ci install` that normalizes SUMMARY artifacts in review and explains how teams should enforce or inspect CADENCE results without replacing CI or human review.

## rec-20260701-001 — Make the default install enforce what the tutorial demonstrates

- evidence: 2026-07-01 audit R-01/F1: comment-only test file (// AC-1) settled green on fresh init, SUMMARY recorded AC-1: PASS, no test runner executed
- next: cadence milestone propose

Out-of-box enforcement chain is hollow: mention-mode coverage counts comments, init never derives verification.testCommand (build-test-must-pass passes silently), all verifier seams are mock. Fix: default coverageMode=assertion for new inits, derive testCommand from package.json scripts.test, print a loud settle notice when no testCommand exists.

## rec-20260703-001 — Milestone-scoped worktree fan-out for independent phases

- evidence: Builds on shipped primitives: phase-collision guard (v1.18, DESIGN.md §13), doctor worktree-phases check + next-free allocation (v1.19), agent-prompt (v1.33), and phase 142's gatherHandoffCandidates/liveLoopPosition (settled 07-03, PR #125, unwired core awaiting a consumer).
- next: cadence milestone propose

External proposal (lumen2 session, grounded against cadence@05f1162/v1.37.0): split into fan-out (provision N sibling worktrees + emit N agent-prompt-shaped hand-off prompts for a milestone's independent PENDING phases) and fan-in (a status/reconciliation command consuming phase 142's gatherHandoffCandidates/liveLoopPosition to show which parallel phases have settled). Recommends starting with fan-in only (Option C) as the more natural next consumer of the just-shipped, still-unwired phase 142 primitive; fan-out (Option A, a new cadence milestone worktrees subcommand) is a bigger, side-effecting surface worth a real cost/benefit pass first. Full writeup: ~/cadence-parallel-phase-worktree-agents-proposal.md

- next: cadence milestone propose

One idempotent command = init + auto-detect/wire whatever host is present (.claude/, Codex, .cursor/, .mcp.json) + auto-populate verification.testCommand from package.json/pyproject/etc + activate if a key is already in env + seed a demo phase + print a doctor-style summary of what it did/skipped. Collapses ~5 separate init flags into one call.

## rec-20260709-002 — cadence doctor --fix: auto-remediate mechanical health-check failures

- next: cadence milestone propose

doctor's checks currently only print fix suggestions. Auto-remediate everything mechanical (rewire host hooks, regenerate host configs, prune stale handoffs past retention budget) so only genuine judgment calls (e.g. verification-readiness) are left as print-and-suggest.

## rec-20260709-003 — cadence init --ci: generate + enforce a CI gate workflow for consumer repos

Detect GitHub/GitLab/etc in a consumer repo and emit a ready-to-commit workflow that re-runs the gate suite on PRs, plus a one-shot recipe/script to make it a required branch-protection check. Closes the gap where gates exist locally but nothing enforces them in the team's actual PR flow.

## rec-20260709-004 — Trustworthy verifier activation: broader key discovery + activation smoke test + committed provider config

- next: cadence milestone propose

Look for a verifier key anywhere it legitimately lives (not just env var), run one real verification call on 'cadence activate' so real verification is proven not assumed, and let the provider choice (not the key) live in committed config so every teammate inherits real verification instead of silently defaulting to mock. Targets the known competitive risk that mock-default undercuts the enforcement wedge.

## rec-20260709-005 — cadence onboard: one-command setup for the 2nd-Nth teammate

- next: cadence milestone propose

For a developer cloning a repo that already has .cadence/ committed: one command does only the per-machine bits (host hooks, local paths, key check) instead of re-running full init. Pair with an init-generated CONTRIBUTING.md snippet so this path is discoverable.
