# @manehorizons/cadence-host-codex

## 1.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f501588: Verifier robustness (v1.15.0): make the real verifier providers dependable in a
  settle gate, let the operator pick one at the command line, and make every
  verifier run's token usage auditable. Provider hardening + ergonomics around
  unchanged verdict logic — not a verifier rewrite.
  - **Provider hardening (Phase 72).** `anthropic` gains configurable
    `verifier.timeoutMs` + `verifier.maxRetries` (threaded via a pure
    `buildAnthropicClientConfig` seam), so a transient 429/5xx/network blip in a
    settle gate retries before failing loud. `local` gains auth: a bearer
    `Authorization` header from `CADENCE_LOCAL_API_KEY` plus arbitrary
    `verifier.localHeaders`, so token-gated OpenAI-compatible proxies work. Header
    values are never logged. Three new backward-compatible `verifier.*` config
    fields.
  - **Verifier selection + cost visibility (Phase 73).** `cadence settle run
--verifier <mock|anthropic|local>` overrides the config-only provider
    selection (precedence flag > config > default `mock`; invalid values rejected
    at parse time). The override flows into the v1.14 mock-fallback banner so it
    reflects the effective provider. `VerifyResult` and the SUMMARY's
    `deepVerifyMeta` gain optional token usage (`inputTokens` / `outputTokens`),
    captured from Anthropic's `usage` and from `local` endpoints that return one.
    Dollar cost is not derived (no price table to rot).

  `cadence-types`, `cadence-host-claude-code`, and `cadence-host-codex` carry
  version-alignment bumps only (the token-usage field on `deepVerifyMeta` lives in
  `cadence-types`; the host adapters are unchanged).

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b8861dc: Verifier correctness (v1.14.0): the `deep-verify` gate now sends the AI verifier
  the actual phase diff instead of an empty string, so deep verification judges the
  implementation rather than test-linkage alone.
  - `deep-verify` wires the memoized `git diff HEAD` (shared with `code-review`) into
    the verifier input, bounded by the new `verifier.diffCapBytes` config (default
    256KB) and truncated with an explicit `[diff truncated: N of M bytes]` marker.
  - A run-level `deepVerifyMeta` provenance record (`diffProvided`, `diffBytes`,
    `truncated`, `filesCount`, `provider`, `model`) is written to the SUMMARY so a
    verdict is auditable.
  - The mock-fallback banner now fires whenever the gate runs in mock — on `--deep`
    **or** gate-set membership (e.g. `standard × complex`) — so a settle never runs
    mock verification silently.

  `cadence-host-claude-code` and `cadence-host-codex` carry version-alignment bumps
  only (no functional change).

### Patch Changes

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- **Multi-host reach: the OpenAI Codex adapter** — a new published package
  `@manehorizons/cadence-host-codex`, the second consumer of the phase-60
  host-adapter contract (`ADAPTER_CONTRACT_VERSION = 1`, unchanged). It proves the
  contract is not Claude-Code-shaped: a genuinely differently-shaped host conforms
  without a contract bump.
  - `codexAdapter satisfies HostAdapter`: capabilities, `mapEvent` (Codex's
    near-1:1 lifecycle → cadence abstract events), and `extractPayload` parsing
    Codex's multi-file `apply_patch` envelope into `ExtractedPayload.files`.
  - `cadence-host-codex install`: project-level `.codex/hooks.json` + global
    `$CODEX_HOME/prompts/cadence-*.md` slash-command prompts (with a global-scope
    warning), `--local`/`CODEX_HOME` aware.
  - `cadence-host-codex hook`: the runtime shim — translates Codex stdin-JSON and
    spawns the core dispatcher; proven end-to-end against real loop state.

  `cadence-core`, `cadence-types`, and `cadence-host-claude-code` carry
  version-alignment bumps to stay in lockstep; no functional change.
